## About Me

Hi, I'm **Arief Daffa Abdullah**, a frontend engineer specializing in
building captivating and user-friendly web experiences. As a frontend
engineer, my primary focus is translating design concepts into
seamless user interfaces.

Graduated from **Brawijaya University** with a Bachelor's degree in Informatics (Computer science) and currently living in **Bekasi, Jawa Barat**.
I was previously working as Software Engineer (Web) intern in **Tokopedia**, and Frontend Engineer in **KawanBantu**.

During my college years, I actively participated in various communities that played a crucial role in refining my skills.
As a proud member of the **Basic Computing Community (BCC)**, affiliated with esteemed organizations like GoTo and Gojek,
I had the privilege of expanding my knowledge base. While my passion primarily lies in **web Frontend Engineering**,
I also enjoy delving into other programming realms, including **Backend Engineering**,
**Android Engineering**, and even dipping my toes into the **realm of DevOps**.
This diverse exploration fuels my continuous growth as a well-rounded developer.

Apart from programming, I have a deep love for movies! If you share an interest in films,
feel free to reach out to me. I can provide you with some of my reviews on movies you've watched or recommend new releases.
If there's a recently released movie you'd like to see, don't hesitate to contact me, and perhaps we can enjoy it together! ðŸ˜‚

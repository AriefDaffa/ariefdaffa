Inspired by a popular band’s lead guitarist, she aspires to be a famous musician but struggles with extreme social anxiety. Her life takes a turn when she meets Nijika Ijichi, the drummer of a struggling band named "Kessoku Band." Nijika invites Hitori to join the band, hoping to add her guitar skills to their group.
